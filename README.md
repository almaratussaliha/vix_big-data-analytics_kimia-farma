### Background
As a Big Data analyst intern, we were asked to create a dashboard of sales data for the brand Salicyl over a year, 
based on the raw data provided.

### About dataset
There are 3 datasets, namely: 'penjualan', 'pelanggan' and 'barang'. These datasets will be imported into Mysql 
and then created a data mart which will be used to create a dashboard.
